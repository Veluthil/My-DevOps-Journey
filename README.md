Welcome to my DevOps Learning Journey! This repository serves as a chronicle of my exploration and growth in the world of DevOps. Here, I'll be documenting my progress through various projects that encompass essential aspects of DevOps, from foundational concepts to advanced tools and technologies.

## About This Repository

In this repository, you'll find a series of projects that reflect my hands-on experience and learning path in DevOps. Each project focuses on a specific area, allowing me to dive deep into topics that shape the DevOps landscape. From Linux to CloudFormation, I'll be covering a range of subjects that contribute to a holistic understanding of DevOps practices.

## Projects Included (And Will Include)

1. **Linux, AWS, Bash & Python Scripting:** Delve into Linux, AWS services, and scripting languages. Learn how to navigate Linux environments, automate tasks using Bash and Python scripts, and leverage AWS resources.

2. **Jenkins:** Explore Jenkins, a popular tool for continuous integration and continuous delivery. Discover how to set up pipelines, automate builds, and streamline the deployment process.

3. **Ansible:** Master Ansible, a powerful configuration management tool. Dive into automating infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and maintaining consistency. (in progress)

4. **Docker:** Immerse yourself in containerization with Docker. Understand the concepts of containerization, create containerized applications, and manage them effectively. (in progress)

5. **Kubernetes:** Dive into Kubernetes, the industry-standard container orchestration platform. Learn to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications seamlessly. (in progress)

6. **Cloudformation & Terraform:** Explore infrastructure as code (IaC) using CloudFormation and Terraform. Understand how to define and provision cloud resources in an automated and repeatable manner. (in progress)

## How to Navigate

1. Each project folder contains its own README file, providing instructions and explanations for the associated tasks.
2. To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project that interests you.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the README to complete the project and gain hands-on experience.

## My Learning Goals

My aim is to not only acquire technical skills but also to gain a holistic understanding of DevOps principles. I will apply my learnings to real-world scenarios and challenges, solidifying my expertise and enhancing my problem-solving abilities.
